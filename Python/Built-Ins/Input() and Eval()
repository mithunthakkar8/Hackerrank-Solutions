# Take two inputs x and k from the user, separated by a space
# x is a value that will be substituted into the expression P, and k is the integer to compare the result against
x, k = input().split()

# Take another input P which represents a mathematical expression involving the variable 'x'
# Example: P could be something like "2*x + 3"
P = input()

# Replace the variable 'x' in the expression P with the value of x provided by the user
# This transforms the string P into a valid mathematical expression (e.g., "2*5 + 3" if x was 5)
P_expression = P.replace('x', x)

# Evaluate the transformed expression using the eval() function
# eval() will calculate the result of the expression (e.g., 13 if the expression was "2*5 + 3")
P_expression_result = eval(P_expression)

# Compare the result of the evaluated expression with the integer value of k
# If the two are equal, it prints True; otherwise, it prints False
print(int(k) == P_expression_result)
