# Take two inputs x and k from the user, separated by a space
# x is a string representing the value to substitute into the expression, 
# and k is the integer value that will be compared with the result of the evaluated expression
x, k = input().split()

# Take another input P, which is a mathematical expression involving the variable 'x'
# Example: P could be something like "2*x + 3"
P = input()

# Convert the value of x from a string to an integer for mathematical calculations
x = int(x)

# Use eval() to evaluate the expression P after replacing 'x' with the value of x
# For example, if P is "2*x + 3" and x is 5, eval() will compute 2*5 + 3 = 13
P_expression_result = eval(P)

# Compare the result of the evaluated expression with the integer value of k
# If the result of the expression is equal to k, it prints True; otherwise, it prints False
print(int(k) == P_expression_result)
